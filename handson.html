      <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <li>
          CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or
          in other media.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="span1">CSS is not neccesary</span
          ><span class="span2"> Css saves lot of work.</span>It can control the
          layout pf multiple web pages all at once
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="span3"
            >External stylesheets are stored in css files</span
          >
        </li>

    </div>

    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>

    <div class="div2">
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Inline - by using style attributr inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>
          External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.
        </li>
        <li>
          The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external in
          external CSS files. However,
          <span class="span4"
            >in the tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span
          >
          because this is easier to demonstrate.add easier for you try it
          yourself.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="div3">
      <p>
        When compounding CSS class vs ID,the difference is that CSS class
        applies a style to multiple elements. ID,on the other head, applies a
        style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a
        special URl to link directly to an element and it's used by javascript.
      </p>

      <p>
        In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of
        element or range of elements on web page. once an element has been
        targeted ,a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is a wide range of selector available. Two os the most commonly
        used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style
        should be applied.
